        Welcome to Nutrition App!\n
        This application is your very smart, very adorable companion.\n
        If you\'re ever curious about what is hiding in your food, 
        just take a quick snapshot using the camera button,
        and watch as computer magic sends its nutrition info to your phone!\n
        This application was designed by three poor, starving college students,
        so give us money!
